## Why I Built This

For fun, obviously! But it‚Äôs also a great way to experiment with random numbers and weighted probabilities. You can adjust the number of symbols, their values, and weights to see how wins and losses evolve.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tjaloc/Console_Slot_Machine.git
